"Define Machine Learning","Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions."
"What is Deep Learning?","Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns."
"What is a LLM?","LLM stands for Large Language Model, like GPT, trained on massive text datasets to generate human-like language."
"What is a RAG Pipeline?","A RAG Pipeline integrates retrieval of relevant documents with a generative model to provide context-aware answers."
"Define Knowledge Base","A Knowledge Base is a structured repository of information that AI systems can query for answers."
"Difference between AI and ML","AI is the broader concept of machines performing intelligent tasks, while ML is a method to achieve AI through learning from data."
"Explain embeddings in AI","Embeddings are vector representations of data that capture semantic meaning for AI models."
"What is a neural network?","A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain that processes data through interconnected layers."
"What is supervised learning?","Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data."
"What is unsupervised learning?","Unsupervised learning is ML where the model identifies patterns in unlabeled data."
"What is reinforcement learning?","Reinforcement learning is an area of ML where agents learn to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties."
"What is a transformer model?","A transformer is a deep learning model architecture widely used for NLP tasks like translation and text generation."
"What is attention mechanism?","Attention allows a model to focus on relevant parts of input data when making predictions."
"Define tokenization","Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units like words or subwords for NLP models."
"What is fine-tuning?","Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset."
"What is zero-shot learning?","Zero-shot learning is when a model performs tasks without being explicitly trained on them."
"What is few-shot learning?","Few-shot learning allows a model to generalize from a very small number of examples."
"Define vector search","Vector search is a method of finding similar data points by comparing their vector embeddings."
"What is cosine similarity?","Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors based on the cosine of the angle between them."
"What is generative AI?","Generative AI creates new content such as text, images, or music based on patterns learned from data."
"Difference between retrieval and generation","Retrieval fetches relevant information from a dataset, generation produces new content using a model."
"What is context-aware AI?","Context-aware AI uses surrounding information to provide more relevant and accurate outputs."
"Define chatbot","A chatbot is a conversational agent that interacts with users via text or speech."
"What is prompt engineering?","Prompt engineering is designing input prompts to guide the behavior of a language model."

"What is a knowledge graph?","A knowledge graph represents relationships between entities to enhance AI reasoning."
"Define embeddings index","An embeddings index stores vector representations for fast similarity search."
"What is multi-turn conversation?","Multi-turn conversation is when an AI maintains context across multiple interactions."
"What is reasoning in AI?","Reasoning is the ability of an AI system to infer conclusions from data or rules."
"What is human-in-the-loop AI?","Human-in-the-loop AI involves human feedback to improve model decisions."
"Define document retrieval","Document retrieval is the process of finding relevant documents from a corpus."
"What is generative pre-training?","Generative pre-training is training a model to predict or generate text before fine-tuning on specific tasks."
"What is API integration in AI?","API integration allows an AI model to communicate with external applications or services."
"What is semantic similarity?","Semantic similarity measures how close two pieces of text are in meaning."
